# What is Space_Cruiserzz?

Space_Cruiserzz is a website which developed to provide information about Heliophysics and its missions. It is an interactive visualization tool. It comprises of an Augmented version of the entire solar system, some fun games, etc. The AR version gives the user the ability to explore the entire solar system, its planets and some of the missions launched such as the Parker Solar Probe, some asteroids 3D view, etc. The challenge "Unlocking the Secrets of the Sun"  asks for spreading awareness and curiosity among the general public about the Sun and the missions launched to explore the Sun. Our solution tries to invoke curiosity about the sun in the future generation.

The core of our website is to develop a method to improve public awareness and understanding of the missions launched to explore the sun and how the valuable data they provide impacts the way we live, work, and play. The existing websites cover the content regarding the topic but there are multiple portals for each which need to be searched individually thus leading to a tedious time consuming search. The website is made to attract people of all ages.

# Our website consists of 4 features:

Eyes on Solar System
Games
Videos
News
